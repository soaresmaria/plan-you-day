## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project is to build a calendar application that allows a user to save an event for each hour of the day from the HTML and CSS provided. The app runs in the browser and is a combination of HTML, CSS and jQuery. The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar and there are time blocks for each hour that a user can fill in. The time blocks are color coded to notate if it is the past, present, or future. The user can select the time block and enter in an event for the day, once they click save, it is saved to local storage.
